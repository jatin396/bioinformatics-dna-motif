# DNA Motif Finder (with Mismatch Support)

This project is a simple bioinformatics tool that finds DNA motifs (short patterns) in a larger DNA sequence, allowing for a certain number of mismatches.

## What it does:
- Accepts a DNA string
- Accepts a short pattern (e.g., "TAC")
- Allows you to search with up to 1 mismatch
- Outputs all positions where the pattern appears with â‰¤ mismatches

## Skills used:
- Python programming
- Hamming distance algorithm
- Bioinformatics string matching
